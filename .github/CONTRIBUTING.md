## Submitting a Pull Request

Usually it's preferable to open a _draft_ Pull Request as soon as possible so that
discussion can start soon and make the feedback loop as short and fast as possible.

Pull Requests must contain the following information:

- Title must be a brief summary of the proposed changes (a-la commit style). Example:
  ```
  feat(AWS): support client config for AWS
  ```
  The PR title will become the commit that will be created on the base branch, so it's important it's brief but clear.
- Description must include a short list of the changes done and the issue number or JIRA ticket ID.

## Submitting a Feature Request or Bug Report
